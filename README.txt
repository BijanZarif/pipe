The attached two data files here are the DNS statistics of fully developed turbulent pipe flow at Re_D=44,000 and Re_D=5,300. 

Reference is "A direct numerical simulation study on the mean velocity characteristics in turbulent pipe flow" by Xiaohua Wu and Parviz Moin, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 608 pp. 81-112, 2008.

Addendum July 1st, 2010:
A new set of DNS pipe flow statistics at Re_D=24,580 (with axial domain length
of 30R) have been uploaded.
